This code is tested using `python 3.8`

Installing the dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Example of a command to run the code:

`python run_pacmoo.py --problem_name OSY --initial_points 6 --iterations 100 --preferences 0.8 0.2 --balance 0.5 0.5 --seeds 5`

The problem name, number of initial points, number of BO iterations, preferences for objectives, the balance between objectives and constraints, and the number of seeds can be changed.
